I have implemented KNN and KNN with KFold algorith in seperate .py files.
I have used Blood Transfusion Database from the UCI link given by professor as my 3rd data base.
Each output is written to a text file with the accuracy of the model.
I have included output for all the three cases bsaed on my sample runs.
I have combined the label class in the main csv file itself.
For SVM is used Weka 3.7.
